# HA9 python control library

[Manual](./Documents/JDS_HA9_Manual.pdf)

This is functional for most basic operations.

Hidden functions implemented automatically via the commands.yml
file allow access to more complex operations.

pull requests (or just messages with requests) are welcome for
implementing user facing functions for some of the more complex
operations.
